PAROL6 commander software is tool for controlling and programming PAROL6 robotic arm!
Some of the features are: <br />
* Loop rates of up to 100Hz allowing for real time control
* Joint jogging
* Cartesian level jogging in world reference frame and tool reference frame
* Full telemetry data
* Error handling like Inverse kinematics errors, Joint position limits, speed limits, Estop...
* Response log 
* Built in simulator
* Programming interface with simple to use commands
* Real time control of robot outputs and reading of inputs



# What is PAROL6 robotic arm?

<img src="Images/img3.png" alt="drawing" width="5000"/>

PAROL6 is a high-performance 3D-printed desktop robotic arm. The design approach of PAROL6 was to be similar to industrial robots in terms of mechanical design, control software, and usability. Control software, GUI, and robots STL files are open-source. You can build your own PAROL6 robot by following the instructions on this page.

# Support the project

All the code and STL files needed to build the robot are Open source and free to all and I would like to keep it that way. Any help 
in terms of donations, advice, or contribution is really appreciated. Thank you!
